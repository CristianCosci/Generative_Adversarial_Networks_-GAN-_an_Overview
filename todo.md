# **AI SCHOOL PROJECT TODO LIST**
### **Literature**
- [x] Read lecterature about GAN    [link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.2661.pdf)
- [x] Read lecterature about DCGAN  [link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.06434v2.pdf)
- [x] Read lecterature about cGAN   [link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.1784.pdf)
- [x] Read lecterature about cDCGAN [link](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/331915834_Designing_nanophotonic_structures_using_conditional-deep_convolutional_generative_adversarial_networks)
- [x] List some paper about state of the art

### **Project start**
- [x] Start to implement my own project
- [x] GAN implementation
    - [x] setup notebook and .py file
- [] cGAN implementation
    - [] setup notebook and .py file
- [ ] try other models
- [ ] Try to change dataset
- [ ] Learn info about training
- [ ] next task as to be written later

### **Report task**
- [x] Initialize latex documentation
- [ ] Initialize readme?

### **Other**
- I think that i need to implement training in notebook and then write some app that use the weights and create image by promt
- Make gif for readme
